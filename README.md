# SoK: Using Dynamic Binary Instrumentation for Security
This repository hosts the code for the paper "SoK: Using Dynamic Binary Instrumentation for Security (And How You May Get Caught Red Handed)" that will appear at upcoming ACM ASIA CCS 2019 in July. We will publish the code in the next few weeks: meanwhile just drop us a line at delia@diag.uniroma1.it to get access to the current (_unpolished_) version.

You can find the pre-print version of the paper [here](https://www.diag.uniroma1.it/~delia/papers/asiaccs2019.pdf) and on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332849052_SoK_Using_Dynamic_Binary_Instrumentation_for_Security_And_How_You_May_Get_Caught_Red_Handed).
